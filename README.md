A simple script picking random x-number of dishes, creating a shopping list and sending it to your prefered email adress. 

Instructions: 
Place all dishes in a folder. 
Every dish has to look like the example (8.txt) which is:
  1. "Shopping list:" being the third line 
  2. Every ingredient in a separate line 
  3. Ending the list with three dots ("...")
  
 To use the email service you need three things: 
  1. Gmail account 
  2. Target account
  
 To login to the account from which you'll be sending the email you need to put
  1. your Gmail email adress, 
  2. target email adress, 
  3. password to your Gmail account 
 (all in separate lines) in a file named "credentials.txt" 
 or simply put them in the code
